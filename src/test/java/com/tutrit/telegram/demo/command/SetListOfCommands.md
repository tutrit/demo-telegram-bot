Just go back to @BotFather on Telegram and type “/setcommands”. 
The bot will ask you which of your chatbots to use, and then prompt to enter the list of commands.
Type your commands (one per line) with simple descriptions.

Example
```
OK. Send me a list of commands for your bot. Please use this format:

command1 - Description
command2 - Another description

```

```
start - bot hello message
help - how to use bot
settings - set user preferable options
```
